# Google Calendar Setup Guide

To enable Google Calendar integration in your motivation dashboard, you have two options:

## Option A: Service Account (Recommended for Headless Servers)
## Option B: OAuth (For Interactive Use)

Choose the method that fits your setup:

## Setup Steps (Both Methods)

### 1. Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" â†’ "New Project"
3. Name your project (e.g., "E-Ink Dashboard")
4. Click "Create"

### 2. Enable Google Calendar API

1. In your project dashboard, go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
2. Search for "Google Calendar API"
3. Click on it and press "Enable"

## Option A: Service Account Setup (Headless Servers)

### 3A. Create Service Account

1. Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "Service Account"
3. Name it (e.g., "eink-dashboard-service")
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Skip role assignment (click "Continue")
6. Click "Done"

### 4A. Generate Service Account Key

1. Click on your newly created service account
2. Go to "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" â†’ "Create new key"
4. Choose "JSON" format
5. Click "Create"
6. **Save the downloaded file as `service_account.json` in your project root**

### 5A. Share Calendar with Service Account

1. Open Google Calendar in your browser
2. Go to your calendar settings (gear icon â†’ Settings)
3. Click on your calendar â†’ "Share with specific people"
4. Add the service account email (found in `service_account.json` as `client_email`)
5. Give it "See all event details" permission
6. Click "Send"

---

## Option B: OAuth Setup (Interactive Use)

### 3B. Create OAuth Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth client ID"
3. If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen:
   - Choose "External" user type
   - Fill in required fields (App name, User support email, Developer email)
   - Add your email to test users
   - Save and continue through all steps
4. For Application type, choose "Desktop application"
5. Name it (e.g., "E-Ink Dashboard Client")
6. Click "Create"
7. Download the `credentials.json` file
8. **Place `credentials.json` in your project root directory**

## 4. First-Time Authentication

When you first run the motivation dashboard:

1. The script will open a web browser
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Grant permission for the app to read your calendar
4. The script will create a `token.json` file for future use

## 5. Security Notes

- Keep `credentials.json` and `token.json` secure
- Add them to `.gitignore` if using version control
- The app only requests read-only access to your calendar
- You can revoke access anytime in your Google Account settings

## Troubleshooting

### Service Account Issues
- **"service_account.json not found"**: Make sure the file is in your project root
- **"Access denied"**: Verify you've shared your calendar with the service account email
- **"Invalid credentials"**: Check that the service account key is valid and not expired

### OAuth Issues
- **"credentials.json not found"**: Make sure the file is in your project root
- **"Access blocked"**: Check that your email is in the test users list
- **"Invalid credentials"**: Delete `token.json` and re-authenticate
- **"Headless environment detected"**: Use service account method instead

### General Issues
- **API quota exceeded**: You have a daily limit; the app caches data to minimize API calls
- **No events showing**: Check that your calendar has events and the service account has access

## Security Notes

- Keep `service_account.json` and `credentials.json` secure
- Add them to `.gitignore` if using version control
- The app only requests read-only access to your calendar
- You can revoke access anytime in your Google Account settings

## Permissions

The app requests these permissions:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` - Read your calendar events

That's it! Your motivation dashboard will now show your upcoming calendar events alongside the Japanese word of the day! ðŸŒ¸
